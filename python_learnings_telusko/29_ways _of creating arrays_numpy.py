In Numpy is you put the array have allows same elements doesnt allows different values
but in numpy the array function we give the elements in the int type that numpy convert float type.
linspace you create the parts and break down range number of the parts
logspace between the gap two elements will be the same
zeros function says size 
ones function says 0,1,you put the (5,int)that case i used intgers that function execute.
